## What is NaowhQOL?

NaowhQOL is a performance and gameplay-focused addon designed to improve your World of Warcraft experience by enhancing system performance, gameplay clarity, and player awareness without changing your UI or adding visual clutter.

This is not a UI pack.
This is not a visual overhaul.
This is a modular Quality of Life system.
